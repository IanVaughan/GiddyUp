Ideas/Todos
-----------
- List branches for each project in drop down

- add field for port number (defaulted from forman, can override)

- fix tail log files in open iterm

- maybe add link to open the log file in tabs

- I think this is required

#export WLD_SITE_ID=1000
#echo "Using WLD_SITE_ID:$WLD_SITE_ID"

- should this be used?

    Process.detach(pid)


### Views

- add tick/untick

- add field to add/remove base path for projects (remove default path from app)

- then get projects from dir and not default_projects
